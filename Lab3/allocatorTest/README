COMP 412, Fall 2015

This directory contains a set of tools to assist in Lab 1.

RunAll -- takes each ILOC file in a directory, runs it through
       the ILOC simulator using the command-line flags specified
       in the "SIM INPUT" comment, and compares the results of
       that simulated execution against the results specified in
       the "OUTPUT" comment.  It reports both whether the OUTPUT
       specs match the code's behavior and the number of cycles 
       that the simulator required to execute the code.

       Syntax:
		RunAll

       Shell variables defined in "RunAll" specify locations for
       the various tools and some of the parameters that they use.

       The easiest way to use this script is to copy RunAll into
       your directory and then execute it as ./RunAll

       NOTE: This script will be used to test the correctness of
       the "test block" that you submit with your lab 1 report.
       You should use the script to check the block before you 
       submit it.

AllocAndRunAll -- takes each ILOC file in a directory, runs it
       through a register allocator; runs the output of that
       allocator through the simulator; and compares the results
       of the simulated execution against the original file's 
       OUTPUT spec.

       Syntax:
		AllocAndRunAll k

       where "k" is the number of registers that the allocator
       should target.

       Shell variables defined in "AllocAndRunAll" specify locations
       for the various tools and some of the paramters that they 
       use.

       The easiest way to use this script is to copy AllocAndRunAll and
       AllocHelper into your directory, make any changes that you need,
       and then execute 

       	    	./AllocAndRunAll k

       where k is a small integer specifying the number of registers
       for the allocator to use.
